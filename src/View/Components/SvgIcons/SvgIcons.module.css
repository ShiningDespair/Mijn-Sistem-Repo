/*
The SvgIcons component (src/View/Components/SvgIcons/SvgIcons.jsx)
is a container for SVG <symbol> definitions. It is not meant to be visibly styled itself;
its main <svg> element has `display: none;`.

The individual SVG icons defined here are styled when they are used
elsewhere in the application via <svg><use xlink:href="#icon-id"></use></svg>,
where the <svg> instance would receive appropriate classes for sizing, color, etc.

No specific custom CSS rules unique to this definitional component were found
in style.css.old, nor are they expected.

This file is kept for structural consistency.

.svgDefinitions {
    /* This class would apply to the main <svg> element if it were visible */
    /* For example:
    display: none !important;
    */
}
