/*
The Popular Tags section (src/View/Components/PopularTags/PopularTags.jsx)
is styled using Bootstrap utility classes for the overall section padding and
Bootstrap button classes (btn, btn-warning, me-2, mb-2) for the tags themselves.

The .btn-warning styles are custom defined globally in the theme (e.g., in global.css)
and are not specific to this component instance.

No specific custom CSS rules unique to this component's structure or its tags
were found in style.css.old that would require being extracted into this module.

This file is kept for structural consistency. If component-specific layout or
tag styling adjustments are needed in the future (beyond global .btn-warning),
they can be added here.
