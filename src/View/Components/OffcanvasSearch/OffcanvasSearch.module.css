/*
The Offcanvas Search component (src/View/Components/OffcanvasSearch/OffcanvasSearch.jsx)
is primarily styled using Bootstrap's offcanvas classes, form control classes,
button classes, and utility classes.

No specific custom CSS rules unique to this component's structure were found
in style.css.old that would require being extracted into this module.
Global overrides for forms and buttons would apply.

This file is kept for structural consistency. If component-specific styles
are needed in the future (e.g., for search results listing if added),
they can be added here.
