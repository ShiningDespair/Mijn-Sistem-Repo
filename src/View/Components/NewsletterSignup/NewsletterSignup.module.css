/*
The Newsletter Signup section (src/View/Components/NewsletterSignup/NewsletterSignup.jsx)
is primarily styled using Bootstrap utility classes (e.g., bg-secondary, py-5, text-white, form-control, btn, btn-primary)
and global theme styles defined for typography and form elements.

No specific custom CSS rules unique to this component were found in style.css.old
that would require being extracted into this module.

This file is kept for structural consistency. If component-specific styles
are needed in the future, they can be added here.
